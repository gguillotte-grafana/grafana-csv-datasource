# CSV data source plugin

You can use the open-source CSV data source plugin for Grafana to visualize data from any URL that returns CSV data, such as REST APIs or static file servers.
You can also load CSV data from a local file.

The plugin doesn't keep a record of previous queries, so each query needs to contain the complete data set you want to visualize.
To visualize how data changes over time, we recommend that you store the data in a database instead of in CSV files.
